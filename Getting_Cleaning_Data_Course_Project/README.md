## Getting and Cleaning Data Course Project

Prasad Kodibagkar

### Overview
This project serves to demonstrate the collection and cleaning of a tidy data set that can be used for subsequent
analysis. A full description of the data used in this project can be found at [The UCI Machine Learning Repository](http://archive.ics.uci.edu/ml/datasets/Human+Activity+Recognition+Using+Smartphones)

### Project Summary
The following is a summary description of the project instructions

You should create one R script called run_analysis.R that does the following. 
1. Merges the training and the test sets to create one data set.
2. Extracts only the measurements on the mean and standard deviation for each measurement. 
3. Uses descriptive activity names to name the activities in the data set
4. Appropriately labels the data set with descriptive activity names. 
5. Creates a second, independent tidy data set with the average of each variable for each activity and each subject. 

### Executing this script
- First unload the data files into a directory of your choice.
- Set the sourcedir variable to the root of the data directory. Eg. C:/Data Science/workspace/cleandata/project/UCI HAR Dataset
- Source the run_Analysis.R file
- MeasurementData.txt output file is written to data directory. The structure of this file is listed in the Codebook.
